# MTLS-projects
In this repository, I'll add interesting projects related to Bioinformatics done during the Molecular Techniques in Life Science Master's
- Read mapping. A phyton script that maps reads to references and calculates the coverage.
- SSP. A ML model to predict secondary structure of proteins using FASTA and PSSM files
